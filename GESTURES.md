## Debouncing & Stability

The gesture engine uses a **4-layer anti-jitter system** to prevent false triggers:

| Layer | Mechanism | Purpose |
|-------|-----------|---------|
| **Temporal Filtering** | One Euro filter smooths landmark positions before classification | Reduces single-frame jitter without adding perceptible lag |
| **Quality Gate** | Confidence scaled by detection + geometric quality; sub-threshold frames don't advance the stabilizer | Prevents a degenerate/occluded pose from misfiring |
| **Frame Stabilizer** | Gesture must be detected for 5 consecutive frames | Eliminates transition noise |
| **Cooldown Gate** | 1200ms lockout after each trigger | Prevents double-fires |
| **Buffer Clearing** | Motion buffers reset after circular/push gestures | Prevents re-triggering |

## Spatial/World-Model Layer

`lib/gesture/spatialModel.ts` sits between raw MediaPipe landmark output and
the classifiers above. It's pure TypeScript with no MediaPipe/DOM dependency
(and has its own unit tests — see `spatialModel.test.ts`), covering three
things:

1. **Temporal filtering** — a One Euro filter (adaptive: heavy smoothing at
   rest, low lag during fast motion) smooths landmark positions before static-
   pose classification. Swipe/circular/push-pull motion buffers deliberately
   stay on **raw** (unfiltered) landmarks, since their thresholds are already
   tuned against raw jitter and filtering would risk damping the fast motion
   they're built to detect.
2. **Orientation/handedness-invariant thumb detection** — replaces the old
   `thumb_tip.x < thumb_ip.x` check (which silently assumed a right hand
   facing the camera and misclassified left hands or a rotated wrist) with a
   hand-size-normalized distance ratio from the thumb tip to the index MCP.
   Tucked-against-the-palm vs. extended-out reads the same regardless of
   which hand or which way it's rotated.
3. **Hand quality scoring** — combines MediaPipe's own per-hand detection
   confidence with a geometric self-consistency check (do finger tip-to-MCP
   distances fall in a plausible range) into a single score that scales down
   reported gesture confidence, so a degenerate/occluded/edge-on hand pose
   gets suppressed rather than misfiring at full confidence.

This intentionally does **not** re-express every `classifyGesture()`
threshold in a fully hand-local, scale-normalized coordinate frame — that
would touch ~20 empirically-tuned distance constants with no way to validate
the recalibration against real camera input outside a live testing session,
and risks silently breaking gestures that work today. If you want to take
that further, add a recorded-landmark-sequence regression fixture per gesture
first so the recalibration can actually be verified.

## 3D World-Model Layer (MediaPipe Tasks)

An **opt-in backend switch**, `vision.mediapipe_backend` (`"legacy"` default
/ `"tasks"`), between the two coordinate systems the gesture engine can run
on:

- **`"legacy"`** (default) — today's `@mediapipe/hands` callback API. Only
  ever exposes normalized image-space landmarks (`x`/`y` in `[0,1]`, `z`
  relative and unitless). This is the "Spatial/World-Model Layer" described
  above — a 2D-normalized-space temporal-filtering + kinematic-extrapolation
  layer, not real 3D.
- **`"tasks"`** — `@mediapipe/tasks-vision`'s `HandLandmarker`
  (`runningMode: "VIDEO"`, `detectForVideo()`), which additionally exposes
  `worldLandmarks`: real-metric-scale 3D coordinates in **meters**,
  hand-center-relative. This is what makes a genuine 3D world-model layer
  possible — the legacy API never gives you metric scale at all.

Flipping the setting requires stopping/restarting the gesture engine (not a
hot-swap mid-session) — see `VisionConfig.mediapipe_backend` in
`daemon/pilot/config.py`.

**What the `"tasks"` backend adds** (`lib/gesture/worldModel.ts`, additive
and separate from `spatialModel.ts`) — and how `GestureControl.svelte`'s
`handleFrameResult()` actually calls each one, live, per frame:

- `toWristRelative3D()` / `handSize3D()` / `pinchDistance3D()` — re-anchors
  `worldLandmarks` (hand-center-relative by default) to the wrist, then
  measures a metric (meters), camera-distance-invariant hand size and
  thumb-to-index-tip distance. Used as a **confirmation signal**: when the
  2D classifier reports `"ok"` or `"pinch"`, the metric pinch-to-hand-size
  ratio is checked against a wide tolerance band, and confidence is only
  ever *reduced* (never raised) if the metric reading strongly disagrees —
  catching 2D-projection false positives where the thumb and index tip
  merely overlap in the camera's view without truly being close in real
  depth. The tuned 2D `PINCH_DISTANCE_THRESHOLD` check itself is untouched.
- `detectPushPull3D()` — a metric-threshold push/pull detector over a raw
  (unfiltered) world-space wrist-position buffer, gated on the same
  all-fingers-extended pose check the 2D version uses. Under the `"tasks"`
  backend this **replaces** the ad hoc `±0.06` normalized-z check entirely
  (the 2D `detectPushPull()` is not called at all in that case) — under
  `"legacy"` the 2D check runs exactly as before, since `worldLandmarks` is
  always `null` there.
- `WorldModelFilterBank` — like `LandmarkFilterBank`, but **coupled** across
  x/y/z: one shared 3D velocity vector per landmark (a single adaptive
  cutoff derived from combined 3D speed), instead of three independently
  extrapolated axes. Currently used to temporally smooth `worldLandmarks`
  before the metric pinch check above (paralleling `landmarkFilter`'s role
  in 2D classification); `predictAhead()` is unit-tested
  (`worldModel.test.ts`) but not yet consumed by a live predictive feature
  the way `LandmarkFilterBank.predictAhead()` feeds the gesture-cursor
  bridge — a natural next step, not yet wired.

**What stays untouched, on the existing 2D path, regardless of which
backend is active**: every `classifyGesture()` static-pose threshold
(finger-extension patterns, orientation checks, the tuned pinch/thumb
distance constants themselves), the gesture-cursor bridge, and gesture
calibration. `GestureControl.svelte` funnels both backends through one
backend-agnostic `handleFrameResult(landmarks, worldLandmarks,
handednessScore)` — the `"legacy"` path always passes `worldLandmarks:
null`, so none of the above 3D logic ever executes for it, and its behavior
is bit-for-bit unchanged. None of the ~20 empirically-tuned 2D distance
constants were re-expressed in 3D (see the caution in the "Spatial/World-
Model Layer" section above — that still applies here unchanged); the 3D
layer only ever adds a confirmation/replacement signal alongside them.

**Delegate**: CPU only, unconditionally — GPU delegate support inside
Tauri's embedded webview (WebView2 on Windows, WebKitGTK on Linux, WKWebView
on macOS) hasn't been verified cross-platform, so it isn't defaulted on.

**Asset serving**: same self-hosted, no-CDN policy as the legacy backend
(enforced by `tests/static/no-remote-mediapipe.test.mjs`). A
`mediapipeTasksVisionAssets()` Vite plugin (`vite.config.ts`, mirroring the
existing `mediapipeHandsAssets()` plugin) serves the `@mediapipe/tasks-vision`
WASM loader files plus the vendored model at `/mediapipe/tasks-vision/*`,
both in dev (middleware) and in the production build (`writeBundle`). CSP
was verified empirically (dev server + a live browser check) to need **no
changes** — `HandLandmarker.createFromOptions()` and its WASM graph start
successfully under the existing `script-src 'self' 'unsafe-eval'` policy,
with no `worker-src`/`blob:` relaxation required.

**Model provenance**: `vendor/mediapipe/hand_landmarker.task` (float16,
~7.8MB) was downloaded from Google's official public MediaPipe model
distribution URL
(`storage.googleapis.com/mediapipe-models/hand_landmarker/hand_landmarker/float16/latest/hand_landmarker.task`)
and its MD5 checksum verified against the source's `x-goog-hash` response
header before committing. **License note**: Google's MediaPipe docs
explicitly license the *code samples* Apache-2.0 but do not explicitly
state a redistribution license for the model *weights* themselves. This
file is vendored anyway on the judgment that it's Google's own official
public distribution URL, used as-is (not fine-tuned or modified) by many
other open-source projects — flagged here rather than silently assumed. If
you need to re-fetch or update it, use the same URL and re-verify the MD5
against `x-goog-hash` before committing.

**Tests**: `worldModel.test.ts` (wrist re-anchoring, metric pinch/hand-size,
push/pull thresholds, and a cosine-similarity check that `predictAhead()`
extrapolates along the true 3D direction of a diagonal motion) and an
extension to `spatialModel.test.ts` (non-zero-z fixtures — every fixture
before this addition used `z: 0` everywhere, so the existing `dist3d()` z
term had zero real regression coverage — plus a numeric-pinning test
confirming the 2D static-pose path stayed bit-identical through this
migration).

**Not verified in this pass** (no physical webcam in the environment this
was built in): the `PUSH_PULL_DEPTH_METERS`/pinch-ratio-tolerance constants'
real-camera accuracy, real-world tracking-quality comparison between
backends, and GPU-delegate behavior on an actual Windows/macOS/Linux Tauri
build. The wiring itself (which functions get called, when, and with what
gating) is code-reviewable and unit-tested per the module's own tests, but
the specific threshold values are approximate until tuned against real
camera data — same caveat the 2D thresholds carried when first introduced.

## Gesture Cursor Control (continuous cursor bridge)

A separate, **off-by-default** mode that continuously drives the real OS
mouse cursor from hand position, rather than firing discrete named gestures.
Enable it in Settings → Gesture Cursor Control (`gesture_cursor.enabled`),
then toggle "Cursor Mode" in the gesture panel while the engine is running —
it is never enabled by a gesture itself.

**While active:**
- The index fingertip's filtered position, blended with its predicted
  near-future position (`prediction_ms`/`blend` settings — see "Prediction"
  below), drives the OS cursor.
- **Pinch fires a click** — evaluated against the *predicted* pinch distance,
  so the click registers a little before the pinch pose has fully, stably
  closed. This is the concrete case of "fire before a gesture completes."
- Every other discrete gesture (all 31 above) is **suppressed** — reaching
  for a swipe or a thumbs-up while pointing would otherwise misfire
  constantly against the cursor-tracking logic.
- **Open palm exits cursor mode immediately** (its existing "Cancel/Stop"
  meaning), checked first every frame, before anything else. The gesture
  panel's stop button and the "Cursor Mode" toggle button both work too.

**Coordinate mapping:** the camera video is mirrored (`scaleX(-1)`) for
natural selfie-view display, but MediaPipe processes the raw, unmirrored
frame — the x coordinate is flipped when mapping to screen pixels so moving
your hand right visually moves the cursor right, matching what you see on
screen rather than the raw camera data.

**Where cursor movement actually comes from:** a native Rust Tauri command
(`move_gesture_cursor`/`click_gesture_cursor` in
`tauri-app/src-tauri/src/commands.rs`, using the `enigo` crate) — not the
Python daemon. The daemon's existing `mouse_move` defaults to a 300ms
pyautogui tween plus a 50ms pause after every call, and the Tauri↔daemon
bridge opens a fresh WebSocket connection per invocation — both make a
sustained ~30fps cursor stream impractical. `enigo` runs in-process instead.
A `cursor_move`/`cursor_click` daemon RPC pair still exists as a degraded
fallback for testing the wiring in a plain browser dev session without a
compiled Tauri binary — see IPC_MESSAGE_FORMATS.md.

**Prediction**: reuses the same `predictAhead()` kinematic extrapolation
described above — a constant-velocity estimate, not a generative model.
`gesture_cursor.blend` (default `0.3`) controls how much of the predicted
vs. current position feeds the cursor; kept modest by default because the
predictor's velocity estimate is empirically amplified for a sustained
motion (see `spatialModel.test.ts`), so a larger blend risks visible
overshoot until this is tuned against real camera data.

**Safety notes:** this is the first gesture feature that continuously drives
real OS input without a per-action confirmation gate, so treat the escape
hatches above as load-bearing, not optional — cursor coordinates are also
clamped to screen bounds before every move, and `Enigo::new()` failing (e.g.
no display session) degrades to a clear error rather than a crash.

---

## Gesture Calibration (on-device continual learning)

A **lightweight, on-by-default** personalization loop that nudges exactly
two of the ~20 hardcoded static-pose constants —
`PINCH_DISTANCE_THRESHOLD` (Pinch/OK) and `THUMB_EXTENDED_RATIO`
(Thumbs Up/Down) — toward an individual user's hand anatomy and pinch
style. These two were chosen because they depend on the hand itself, unlike
e.g. swipe velocity or cooldown timing, which are motion-preference/safety
knobs left untouched.

This is **not** model retraining — MediaPipe stays frozen — and there is no
new "was this right? 👍/👎" prompt. Instead it reads an implicit signal
already latent in normal usage: **gesture reversal detection**. If a
calibrated gesture (pinch/OK/thumbs-up/thumbs-down) fires and is
immediately followed by a semantically contradictory gesture (e.g. an open
palm right after a pinch) within `REVERSAL_WINDOW_MS` (2500ms), that's read
as an implicit misfire and simply isn't reinforced. If nothing contradicts
it in time, the gesture's measured metric (pinch distance / thumb ratio at
the moment it fired) feeds an exponential moving average (`EMA_ALPHA =
0.08`).

The learned EMA only takes effect once at least `MIN_SAMPLES_TO_APPLY`
(8) confirmed observations exist, and is always clamped to
`[0.6x, 1.4x]` of the shipped default — so a single unusual session can't
swing recognition, and drift stays bounded and reversible. Below the sample
floor, the shipped constant is used unchanged.

**Storage:** exclusively browser `localStorage`
(`heliox_gesture_calibration`) — gesture recognition never leaves the
frontend today, so this personalization never needs to either. Nothing is
transmitted anywhere. Visible and resettable from Settings → Gesture
Calibration (`adaptive_calibration.gesture_enabled`), which also shows the
current pinch/thumb sample counts.

See `tauri-app/ui/src/lib/gesture/calibration.ts` for the implementation
and `calibration.test.ts` for coverage of the EMA math, clamping, and
reversal-pairing logic.

## Detection Algorithms

### Static Pose Detection

Each of the 21 hand landmarks from MediaPipe is analyzed (landmarks are
temporally filtered by the spatial/world-model layer before this step — see
above):
- **Finger extension**: `tip.y < pip.y` means the finger is extended (up)
- **Thumb extension**: hand-size-normalized distance from thumb tip to index
  MCP (`spatialModel.ts`'s `isThumbExtended()`) — orientation and handedness
  invariant, unlike a raw `x` coordinate comparison
- **Tip distance**: `dist(thumb_tip, index_tip)` for OK/Pinch gestures
- **Orientation**: Comparing average fingertip Y vs wrist Y for palm up/down

Gestures are checked **most-specific-first** to prevent ambiguity:
1. Orientation-dependent (Palm Down/Up)
2. Multi-touch (OK, Pinch, Snap Ready, Crossed)
3. Single-finger (Middle, Pinky)
4. Compound (Devil Horns, Finger Gun, Call Me)
5. Simple (Fist, Palm, Peace, Point)

### Circular Motion Detection

Uses a **12-point index finger position buffer**:

```
1. Compute centroid: cx = mean(x), cy = mean(y)
2. Compute radius of each point from centroid
3. Check circularity: stddev(radii) < 50% of avgRadius
4. Determine direction via cross product sum:
   crossSum > 0 → Clockwise  → Volume Up
   crossSum < 0 → Counter-CW → Volume Down
```

### Palm Push/Pull (Z-Axis Depth)

Uses an **8-point wrist history with Z-coordinate** from MediaPipe:

```
1. Compare Z-depth: newest.z - oldest.z
2. Requires elapsed time: 100ms < elapsed < 600ms
3. All 4 fingers must be extended (open palm pose)
4. dz < -0.06 → Push forward (confirm)
5. dz > +0.06 → Pull back (cancel)
```

## Adding New Gestures

To add a new gesture:

1. **Define the finger pattern** in `classifyGesture()` inside `GestureControl.svelte` — place it in priority order
2. **Add an emoji** to the `GESTURE_EMOJIS` map
3. **Add an action** in `executeGestureAction()` — call `session.sendCommand()` or `session.addSystemMessage()`
4. **Handle in `App.svelte`** if it needs to trigger UI navigation (tab switching, etc.)
